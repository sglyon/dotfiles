    // "command_name" gives you the chance to name different commands
// that will be displayed when opening a new console view.
// e.g. " -p 4" could be used for a command that starts julia -p 4

// "julia" refers to the absolute path of your julia executable.
// By default, it is assumed that your julia is in your system PATH.
// To launch a specific julia executable or if your julia is NOT in your
// system PATH, modify your platform's value string below with your
// julia's absolute path.
// e.g. "unix": "/home/username/julia/usr/bin/julia-release-readline"

// "ijulia_kernel" refers to the IJulia backend file that starts up
// the backend. This should not have to be changed at all.

// "zmq_shared_library" refers to the absolute path of the ZMQ
// shared library file. This file is automatically downloaded/built
// with the installation of the IJulia package from within julia.
// The file is located in a standard location on windows and linux (usually)
// but is different on OSX through the homebrew installation.
// The name of the file to locate is "libzmq.dylib" on OSX
// "libzmq.so" or "libzmq.so.3" on linux

// additional commands can be added by copying
