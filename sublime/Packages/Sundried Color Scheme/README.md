[Sundried][homepage] is a colour scheme for [Sublime Text 2][st2]. I created it because I found most dark schemes out there (including Sublime's default) to look too "glowing neon".

It has a simple definition that styles:

* The language-independent [root groups][tmlang] for text and source code.
* Sublime's various visual cues in the text area, including matched brackets and selection / find / line highlights.

This package is available direct from its GitHub homepage, and also via [Sublime Package Control][spc]. If you wish to distribute it otherwise, please contact me first.
