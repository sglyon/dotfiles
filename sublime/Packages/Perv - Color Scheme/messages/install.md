# Perv Color Schemes

Thank you for installing the `Perv Color Schemes`.  I hope you enjoy them.

Currently there are only two variants: `Orange` and `Orange Moonlight`, but more will come eventually.


## Advanced usage

This are some hints to customise the color scheme a bit to your liking (in regards to 'line highlighting' and font faces):

In order to edit the specific scheme file, which you want to use/amend, please select the `Preferences -> Browse Packages` menu entry in Sublime Text.  That will open the Packages directory either in the "Finder" (on Mac OS X) or in the "Explorer" (on Windows).  Go into the "Perv - Color Scheme" directory and drag'n'drop the respective color scheme file, to your Sublime Text editor.  After the file is loaded in the editor do the following regarding what you would like to change

+ If you're using **Line highlight:** search for "highlight_line". There are two "lineHighlight" entries in the file (one is commented out). Just comment the currently active line out and uncomment the other line.

+ **Switch of italic or bold font faces:** search for either "italic" or "bold" in the file.  Just comment the line below the comment/instruction out.  Rinse and repeat for all font faces you want to remove.
