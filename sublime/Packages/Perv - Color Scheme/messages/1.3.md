Perv Color Schemes v1.3 Changelog:

+ _major change_: added new Orange color scheme: **"Moonlight"**

+ _major change_: added support for **"CSS"**, &amp; **"SASS/SCSS"** (through the packages [Syntax Highlighting for Sass](https://github.com/P233/Syntax-highlighting-for-Sass), [SCSS](https://github.com/kuroir/SCSS.tmbundle) and [Sass](https://github.com/nathos/sass-textmate-bundle))

+ _major change_: added support for **"Markdown"** (Standard Sublime Text syntax highlighter) and **"GitHub Flavored Markdown"** through the package [knockdown](https://github.com/aziz/knockdown) (which also adds more highlighting for the standard Markdown syntax to any Markdown files)

+ _major change_: regarding "line highlighting": it is nearly impossible to have one color which works with `highlight_line` turned on or off.  And as I don't use that, I added a second in the tmTheme file for those who do use `highlight_line`. See above for a short description how to change the "line highlight" color

+ _change_: removed *italics* from "function arguments", but they are still rendered in color

+ _change_: updated Ruby embedded source code highlighting

+ _change_: updated JSON highlighting

+ _change_: integrated YAML highlighting

+ _minor change_: updated the SublimeLinter colors

+ _minor change_: adjusted the bracket (underline) colors to fit the "Orange" scheme
