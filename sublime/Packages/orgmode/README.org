orgmode for Sublime Text 2
==========================

* About
  My shot on bringing Org-Mode {3} to Sublime Text 2 {4}. This project {1} is still in very early development. Nobody knows what will come next :). This won't be a simple copycat of the original one. I want to "port" useful things in a way that works best for Sublime Text 2. So there may be things that aren't in either version or just behave more or less differently.

* Features
  Here's a list of all the features implemented so far:

  * Context sensitive highlighting
    - Headlines
    - Pages. E.g.:
      --- This is a page marker ---
    - Breaks. E.g.:
      ~ This is a break.
    - Tacks
    - Tags. E.g.: :important:, :one:two:three:
    - Follow ups. E.g.:
      -> Lorem ipsum.
      => Lorem ipsum.
    - Checkboxes
    - Checkbox summaries
    - External links
    - Inter document links. E.g. {1} {{Context sensitive actions}} {{Todo}}
    - Code blocks
    - Python tracebacks

  * Context sensitive actions
    - Toggle checkbox on pressing enter

      - Plugin: eMail
        - Create call: [[mailto:ok@ryotic.de]]
        - Create call with subject: [[mailto:ok@ryotic.de/some subject]]
    - Auto completion of filenames and directories when writing external links to local files
    - Jump between inter document links on pressing enter (e.g. {1})
    - Jump to linked headline on pressing enter (e.g. {{Installation}})
    - Show an outline of the document on using goto symbol
    - Open Python file at specific line from Python tracebacks when pressing enter on a filepath

* Installation

  * Codebase
    Clone or copy the contents into a Packages/orgmode folder.

  * Key bindings for interaction
    See the file [[Default.sublime-keymap]] for details.

  * Theme additions for proper syntax highlighting
    See {{Theme additions for proper syntax highlighting}} under {{Attachments}} below for details.

* Todo [10/28]
  - [X] HelpIt integrated, alt+f1 looks up th eword on google.
  - [X] redmine, [[redmine:9726]], [[issue:9726]], [[#9726]]
  - [X] local file not working well for windows
      - [X] åäö problems
  - [X] linux open cmd line at "[[cmd:/home]]"
  - [X] open cmd line at "[[cmd:c:\dev]]"
        - [[cmd:c:\dev\]]
        - [[prompt:c:\dev\apps]]
  - [X] http resolver, make urls with '#'' work
      - [[http://www.sublimetext.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=1838&p=18483#p18483]]
      - [X] https is not working, [[https://www.google.com/]]
          -https resolver..
  - [X] navigation history
  - [X] src refactor, moved settings to Global.sublime-settings
  - [X] added default theme in orgmode dir.
  - [X] External link opener on pressing enter [3/3]
    - [X] on OSX
    - [X] on Linux
    - [X] on Windows
  - [ ] When (un-)checking *all* checkboxes of siblings, toggle parent checkbox.
  - [ ] Either make highlight_code_remarks.py configurable thru view settings so that orgmode can control its regex patterns or fork/extend it to archive an equal goal.
  - [ ] Export into formatted text file [0/1]
    - [ ] Format: Markdown
  - [ ] Automatic export after save into given format if mark found in org file.
  - [ ] Fix cursor position after filling checkbox summary on checkbox toggle
  - [ ] Tab trigger "c" [1/2]
    - [X] …which extends into "[ ] "
    - [ ] …and updates the summary
  - [ ] Define special block/area in document where time logging can occur. If one changes the status (TODO, WORKING, DONE etc.) this will be written into the log. Ideas for format are welcome!
  - [ ] If all children don't have checkboxes only show the number of children in the summary
  - [ ] If the summary ends with "%]" calculate percentage instead of amount
  - [ ] If multiple checkboxes are in one line only work with the one under the cursor
  - [ ] If multiple checkbox summaries are in one line only work with the one under the cursor
  - [ ] If mutliple checkbox summaries are in one line update every one of them independently on updating a child checkbox
  - [ ] Move key bindings out of readme into its own file
  - [ ] Move theme additions out of readme into its own file
  - [ ] Implement external link plugin: eMail [2/3]
    - [ ] Open call [[email:ok@ryotic.de/inbox/some title]]
    - [X] Create call [[mailto:ok@ryotic.de]]
    - [X] Create call with subject [[mailto:ok@ryotic.de/some subject]]
  - [ ] Pressing return on a TODO chain shall set it to DONE
  - [ ] ASCII tables.
  - [ ] Code remark collector. Recursively scans a specified folder for files with given filename pattern for code remarks and shows them as a list. Should be realized with begin and end markers to support later update on pressing enter on either marker.


* Known Issues
  - When creating an empty checkbox summary and hitting an checkbox below the cursor will be placed a little bit to the left. Seems like the selection is being rebuilt incorrectly due to the added chars for the summary.
  - Subsequent indent of wrapped paragraphs don't respect stars, tacks, checkboxes, follow ups etc..
    -> [[http://sublimetext.userecho.com/feedback/26943-/]]
  - Update of checkbox summary should only see children who start with either an asterisk, tack or checkbox. Other things like external links or follow ups should be ignored.
