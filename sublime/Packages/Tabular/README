This plug-in is an attempt to reproduce vim tabular functionality in sublimetext

Features:
- align and unalign selection with regular expression
- adjust selection if it doesn't capture the whole lines
- don't align lines without delimiter inside if any are in selection
- use special format for more precise alignment
- multiple selection support

Usage:
1. Select text you want to align
2. Run `tabular` command throw command pallete
3. Input delimiter/[dilimiters_to_use]/[format]
    where:
        1. delimiter: python style regular expression
        2. dilimiters_to_use: optional, list, range or number of which delimiters we should use when aligning
        3. format: optional, columns's alignment, one of l,c,r. Default is l.
