# DobDark Theme

A dark syntax theme for Sublime Text 2.

## Description

This colour scheme has been designed for clarity with vibrant highlights
and cool greys. Colours have been carefully picked and tweaked to offer
good contrast between elements. It also has a couple of interesting
ideas that might appeal to markup authors in particular:

1. Highlighting for markup such as HTML and XML subtly brings to the
   fore the actual content of the elements, rather than the tags
   themselves. Attribute values, which could also be considered a form
   of content, have more prominence than tags. The tags themselves are
   styled with a neutral grey which, while being perfectly legible, can
   be easily ignored if you're focusing on content. The result is a
   hierarchy of highlighting that makes it much easier to read markup.

2. Comments are given less prominence. They fade into the background
   through use of a low-contrast grey. This subtly reduces the noise
   comments can sometimes cause, but still enables the comments to be
   easily looked at when you want to.

DobDark looks great with dark Sublime UI themes such as Soda Dark and
Nil. It also comes with great support for Markdown and
reStructuredText highlighting, plus the SublimeLinter and Bracket
Highlighter packages.

ClearType thanks to its superb hinting.
