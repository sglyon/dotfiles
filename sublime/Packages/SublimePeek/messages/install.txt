SublimePeek
===========

SublimePeek provides quick access to documentation by opening help files in Quick Look. The plugin supports HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Python, Ruby, R, and Stata. Support for other languages can be added easily.
Currently, the plugin only runs on Mac OS but it can be extended to work on other unix systems using gloobus-preview as well as Windows using maComfort. I personally don't have a unix or windows system but it should be pretty easy to add support. Drop me a line and we can make it work!

Using SublimePeek
=================
Just select a function, and press `super+shift+h`. If the language is supported by SublimePeek, you should now see a Quick Look window with the documentation for the function. Actually, you don't have to select the function. SublimePeek automatically uses the word at the current cursor position or the word before the opening `(`. `json.lo|ad`, however, does not work because the dot interrupts the word. 

For all languages except Python and Ruby, SublimePeek can show an overview of all available help topics based on the familiar ST2 quick select panel (the same as the command panel, or the one for jumping from project to project). SublimePeek shows the overview, if no matching help file is found for the current selection. To bring up the overview directly, just make sure that your current selection is not meaningful and you can quickly browse all help topics.


Python and Ruby
===============
The python help files are generated on the fly using `pydoc` for Python and `ri` for Ruby so that both languages should work right away.

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP
==============================
The help files for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP are based on [DocHub](http://dochub.io/). They first need to be downloaded and compiled. SublimePeek can do all the work for you. So just open a corresponding file and start using SublimePeek. The first time you will be asked whether you want to download and compile the files, which takes a moment.

R and Stata
===========
For R, you have to install the help files yourself. They are available as an additional package from Package Control (`SublimePeek-R-help`) or on a separate GitHub repos at https://github.com/jlegewie/SublimePeek-R-help.
Alternatively, SublimePeek contains a help compiler, which allows you to create the help files yourself. Just look in the SublimePeek packages folder under `help-compiler` for the file `R-help.r`. The advantage of compiling the R help files yourself is that the SublimePeek-R-help repos only contains the help files for the base packages and ggplot2. Using the R help compiler creates the help files for all installed R packages.

The Stata help files are currently not available as a separate package but can easily be compiled using the Stata do-file `Stata-help.r` in the `help-compiler` folder. If people are interested in these files, I can add them as an additional ST2 package.
