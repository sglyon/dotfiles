Feedback, Pull Requests Welcome
-------------------------------

I spend most of my time programming in PHP, so this scheme probably needs some tweaks to look really good in other languages.  Please do send me feedback on how it looks for you, and if you send me a pull request, please remember to tell me which syntax you were looking at when you tweaked it!
