Added option to define ``` osascript ``` path because some of you may have problem with PATHs.
From now by path to ``` osascript ``` it's set to ``` /usr/bin/osascript ``` and can be changed in settings.
More info in [issue #8](https://github.com/afterdesign/MacTerminal/issues/8).

For more info how to setup ``` osascript ``` path just checkout [README.md](https://github.com/afterdesign/MacTerminal)

Added "Open in terminal" to command palette.

Some minor (print call) changes and MacTerminal is working with Sublime Text 3 beta !

Thanx to ap0 (https://github.com/ap0) there is default_path to fallback if there is a problem with file path.

There is also some interesting information from Thomas Noe 
about possible issue for people using dropbox for project syncing:
