# Spencer Lyon's dotfiles.

    This includes the following:

    - emacs configuration
    - vim configuration
    - Sublime Text 2 configuration
    - Sublime Text 3 configuration
    - my .zshrc

    To "install" this you need to just make a few symlinks. I created a simple python script to take care of this for me, so on OSX all I had to do was run ``python setup_links.py`` from the terminal within the directory (this should work on all *nix systems).
