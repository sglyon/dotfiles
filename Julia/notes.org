* Parallel setup  :parallel:howto:

  It took some work to get remote parallel processes set up properly. Here are
  the main steps.

  - Set up SSH keys
    - make sure I have file =~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub= on local machine
    - Copy it as a temporary file in =~/.ssh= on remote machine
    - On remote machine, move the contents of the temp file into a file
      =~/.ssh/authorized_keys= using =cat temp_file_name >> authorized_keys=
    - Change permissions on the ~authorized_keys~ file using
      =chmod 600 authorized_keys=
  - Write a couple functions in =~/.juliarc.jl= to automate adding n remote
    processes. See below (needed to add dir b/c I store it in non-standard
    place)

  #+BEGIN_SRC julia
    function addprocs_odyny(n::Int)
      addprocs(repmat(["sglyon@odyny.homeip.net:22"], n),
               tunnel=true,
               dir="/Users/sglyon/.src/julia/usr/bin")
    end

    function addprocs_home(n::Int)
        addprocs(repmat(["spencerlyon2@sglyon.selfip.org:22"], n),
                 tunnel=true,
                 dir="/Users/spencerlyon2q/.src/julia/usr/bin")
    end
  #+END_SRC
