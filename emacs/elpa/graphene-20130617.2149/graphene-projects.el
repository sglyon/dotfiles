;;; Commentary:

;; Graphene is a set of default settings and functionality to make Emacs a little friendlier.
;; This file defines default settings and functionality for project management.
;; It uses Project-persist (https://github.com/rdallasgray/project-persist) as a base
;; for its functionality, adding just the capability to load and save desktops along with project settings,
;; and to open the speedbar at the correct directory location.
